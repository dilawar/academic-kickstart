I am a heavy user of `matplotlib` but secretly I am in love with `tikz` (well
who isn\'t!). I\'ve been training myself with tikz and pgfplots for few years
now, by drawing (umm.. coding) figures for labnotes, journal club and
student\'s seminars. ForÂ [my recent paper published in
eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/41412), I used tikz/pgfplots to draw
all my figures and the results were awesome!

The code and data used to generate these figures are available on [my Github
repository](https://github.com/dilawar/SinghAndBhalla_CaMKII_SubunitExchange_2018/PaperFigures/).

I also made a striking digest image for eLife using Tikz only [code
here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dilawar/SinghAndBhalla_CaMKII_SubunitExchange_2018/master/PaperFigures/Abstract/camkii_xkcd.b.tex).
It turns out to be more suitable for XKCD than for eLife. Nonetheless, I am
proud of it and hope that it makes the cut and get published in 
[eLife digest](https://elifesciences.org/digests) of my paper.

Tikz and pgfplots are great for making neat figures but keep in mind
that they are not for faint hearted. You'd need lot of patience and time
to get comfortable with them (just like vim editor). And just like the
vim Jedi, you'd feel grateful that you put enough effort to become
master of TikZ/pgfplots.
